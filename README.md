<h2>CSS RESET</h2>

<p>The CSS file used is taken from http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15901030/reset-remove-css-styles-for-element-only</p>

<h4>Why reset?</h4>
<p>Browsers have their own style sheet when it comes to reading your file. Notice how the normal button looks on different browsers. Resets clean up all these styles and provide you with a clean (rather boring) skeleton which you can dress up with your own skin or style.</p>
